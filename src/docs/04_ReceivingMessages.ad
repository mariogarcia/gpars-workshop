== Receiving Messages

So far we have focused our efforts on how can we send a message to a given actor. Well in this chapter
we'll be seeing from the other side, we will be focusing on topics such as:

* How an actor receive messages ?
* How can an actor respond to a given message ?
* What type of objects can an actor receive ?
* Is an actor capable of behave differently depending on the object received ?
